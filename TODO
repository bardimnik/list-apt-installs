The program has a basic starting point and just works for the purpose.

Here are things that I could see being useful:

-Do better with docs. install and otherwise needed.

-Ubuntu/Debian packaging

-Add the typical argc/argv scaffolding and cover:
  1. DONE(0.4): added help
  2. DONE(0.4): added version
  3. various possible output format options (--noinstall, --comma, --space, --noendline)
  4. accept output path/filename (instead of requiring redirected output)
  5. various display options(write to file and/or use stdout? suppress everything when called inline)
  6. maybe some logic against resultant output, to prove they are still installed?(--check?)

-Make assurance against injection exploits.

-Manage output between stdout, stderr and file to not contaminate output file


If you can help with anything, code, design ideas, comments, etc, it is welcomed!
